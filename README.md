#Express 3 boilerplate using CoffeeScript, Sass, Jade and Mocha


This boilerplate is the product of experimenting with Node.js. As I wasn't able to find a proper structured stack that fits my needs, I built this boilerplate.


## Documentation

## Install Dependencies

`npm install`

## Run Watcher

The Cakefile includes several tasks for certain environments. To compile Sass and CoffeeScript on the fly start the appropriate watcher by cd'ing into

`./node_modules/coffee-script/bin/`

You are able to run tasks like so

`cake development`
